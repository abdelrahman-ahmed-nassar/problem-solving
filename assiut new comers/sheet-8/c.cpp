/*
C. Koko And The Transformation
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
koko has two arrays a
 and b
, he wants to know if he can transform a
 to b
 in a finite number of steps. In each step he can perform one of two operations:

Pick two values from a and merge them into one value equal to their sum.
Pick value from a and split it into two values such that their sum are equal to the initial value.
koko needs your help, can you find out if he can transform a
 to b
 in a finite number of steps?

Input
The first line of input contains two numbers n
 and m
 (1≤n,m≤105)
 – the number of elements in arrays a and b respectively.

The next line contains n
 integers, the elements in array a
 (0≤ai≤104)
.

The next line contains m
 integers, the elements in array b
 (0≤bi≤104)
.

Output
Print "Yes" if koko can transform a to b in a finite number of steps, else, print "No".

Example
InputCopy
3 5
6 15 6
5 12 0 3 7
OutputCopy
Yes
Note
- One solution to the sample case is: split 15 to 12 and 3, split 6 to 1 and 5, merge 1 and 6 to 7. split 7 to 7 and 0.

- Note that: the order of the numbers in a or b is not important.
